// In this lecture, I learn what is syntax, comments in cpp, types of streams and write first cpp code.

#include<iostream>    // This line means header

using namespace std;  // std make sure thst cout is a part of "iostream"

int main()     // we have written a main "function"
{
    cout << "Hello World!";

    return 0;
}
